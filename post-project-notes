Post Project Notes

After completing the turtle-crossing project I watched how the instructor completed the project.
These are some notes on how she and I did things differently.

- Instead of creating a car class and managing the cars from the main.py file, she made a car manager class.
    - Her way seems like a better approach to grouping all the car logic.
    - Cars are not that different from a base turtle so it makes sense that you wouldn't need a car class separate
        from the car manager.

- Instead of counting loop iterations to spawn a car every 6th loop, she used a random int from 1 - 6 in the generate
    cars method in her car manager class.

- When detecting if the player has collided with a car she kept things simple and only checked if the player is within
    20 of the player instead of trying to make the detection true the the shape of the cars (cars are not squares).
    - This is very pragmatic and if the game still feels good then I don't think the detail matters.

- She used may more constants than I did. I am learning to spot opportunities to use more constants.
    - Using a constant for the font used in the score board felt especially nice.

- She created a method in the score board class to increment the level while I manually incremented level in the
    main loop.
    - Creating a method in the class makes more sense for modularity.
